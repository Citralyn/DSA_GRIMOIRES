        description: "This one is pretty cute. The key idea to this problem is that you want to avoid directly editing the original matrix until the end (or at least, if you do edit it, you do so in a way that keeps track of its original values). There are a few ways to implement a solution. One way to do it, is that you can create a new temporary matrix and update the alive/dead state there, while always counting the neighbors from the original matrix. Then at the end, have the original matrix copy from the temporary matrix. The solution I like (because you can do it in O(1) space), is to give each spot on the board a special marking if itâ€™s alive and then dead, or dead and then alive, and then convert them to their actual values at the end.
