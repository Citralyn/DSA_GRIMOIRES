        description: "This one is a fun trick! You can think of it like this. When you rotate the array, the right k elements move to the left, and the left n-k elements move to the right. EX: arr=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], k = 2. One way to do this is to simply rotate the array! EX: arr=[9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1]. Now all the groups are in the right position. Then, to retain the original order of the number, reverse each group by itself. arr=[9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] -> arr=[8,9,7,6,5,4,3,2,1] -> arr=[8,9,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. You can write your own reverse function, or use the one from the standard library. The STL reverse function runs in O(1) space, because it iterates through half the range, swapping the first and last element each time. Make sure to mod k by n to avoid a buffer overflow because itâ€™s not guaranteed that k is less than n.",
